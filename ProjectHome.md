This project is aimed to store all programming resources from my blog tutorials.

Featured resources (I'm working on documentation on wiki):
  * [PRSerializer](PRSerializer.md)
> > Python Recursive Serializer. A safe and fast serializer.
  * [appSession](appSession.md)
> > Google App Engine (Python) simple session system using encrypted cookies and memcache.
  * [rhp](rhp.md)
> > Raw HTML Parser is a standard compliant HTML/XHTML parser and DOM manipulator for Javascript. It's intended to replace the ugly, unsafe, and non-standard writeHTML method.
